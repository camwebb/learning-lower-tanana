## Session 1

OK, let’s start with a common greeting:

> do’eent’a  {lt1a,24,26} (da-eenta) - how are you? 

And immediately we begin an aside on notation! In my language entries,
the first word (or two) is the Lower Tanana (LT) orthography as I find
it in the written resources. There are two _orthographies_ (symbolic
conventions for transcribing sounds): “Kh-” and “X-”. The former is
derived from the Koyukon orthography, and is more widely used in
leaner material. The latter (created by Jim Kari) is intended to be
shorter and easier to type (`lt3`, p.19), and is similar to the
Tanacross and Upper Tanana (UT) orthographies. Sadly (for the
learner), useful material is in both, and sometimes I’ll give both, with
the “Kh-” version first, and the “X-” version after a slash.  The main
differences are “ee” vs. “i”, “oo” vs. “u”, “u” vs. “w” and “kh”
vs. “x”, so if you see a “ee”, it’ll be the “Kh-” orthography.

After the LT word(s), is a clickable <img src="img/lt1.png"
height="15"/> symbol. This is a recording of the word(s), mainly from
`lt1` (spoken by Ellen Frank <img src="img/lt1.png" height="15"/>) or
`lt2` (spoken by Isabel Charlie <img src="img/lt2.png" height="15"/>),
or both. I’ve sometimes written my own orthography after the
recording, in parentheses, mainly for my own use when the “standard”
trnascription doesn’t match what I hear; for example, in the above I
can hardly hear the glottal stop after the “t” (but I may hear it more
as I learn). The “o” vs. “a” in “do’eent’a” may be just local
variation. Finally, I’ll give a translation. If it helps to see the
literal translation, I’ll give that last, in parentheses.

Phew! Back to the language. The reply to “do’eent’a” is “eszroonh”:

> eszroonh / eszrunh {lt1a,32,34}{lt2a,1482,1484} - I am fine

Negation (here) is by adding a “-ą” (a nasal, rising “a”):

> eszrooną / eszruną {lt1a,74,76} - I am not fine

Grammatical [person](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_person)
is changed here to third person singular by adding a “n-”:

> neszroonh {lt1a,84,86} (neszoonh) - he is fine

“I am fine” is not a real verb, of course, but the verb “to be” with
an adjective. Verbs in LT (and Dene languages in general), are very
complex, with a great number of prefixes and suffixes that construct
the meaning of the verb phrase, with the whole construction sometimes
containing the elements of a whole English sentence. Koyukon has more
the 25 “slots” in a verb phrase’s formation!  As I learn more (much of
it from `lt3`), I’ll share what I find. But start with a look at some “eat” verb constructions:

> / ch’es’oł - I am eating <br/>
> / ch’edhes’olą - I am not eating <br/>
> / ch’i’oł - you (sing.) are eating <br/>
> / ch’edhi’olą - you (sing.) are not eating <br/>
> / ch’e’oł  {lt2a,1762,1764} - he is eating <br/>
> / ch’eth’olą - he is not eating

Wow! This is how it seems to work (`lt3` p.52): the root word, or
“stem” is “otl” (or “ol” or “oł”). The conjugation (person) is in the
middle: “es”, “i”, etc. And the “ch” at the beginning indicates an
indefinite object (something in general, versus a spefic object that
is eaten).

Enough verb information for today. Back to some nouns. And some
background: one of the main reasons I want to learn LT is that I want
to know the LT names for the classes of biological and physical thing
I meet in the forests around my home, as well as the place names for
the specific places. These are the names used by the people who knew
this land best. Through the names, I hope to learn of the stories
about and the nature of those things, and perhaps... even come to
“know” those things myself in a different way. So... there will be
lots of plant and animal names listed during my learning of LT. And where better to start than the trees:

> ts’eba / ts’eba  {lt1a,751.2,753}{lt2a,685,687} (ts’ba) - spruce <br/>
> k’eeyh / k’iyh {lt1a,762,765}{lt2b,243.5,246} - birch <br/>
> / k’wy’ {lt2a,348.4,350} - willow

<!-- 
 Ye’ogu khudeezroonh {lt1a,275.5,279} - it’s (a) nice (day)
